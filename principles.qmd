# Applying the Principles

## The Pyramid of Communication

![Pyramid of Communication](pyramid_of_communication.png)

#### Key Takeaway: There should be a grocery store in Downtown Wilmington.
We recommend developing a full-service grocery store in Downtown Wilmington because the area is underserved, economically primed for investment, and aligned with broader public and private revitalization efforts.

#### Main Point #1: Market Demand: There is clear unmet need for grocery access
* Downtown Wilmington is classified as a USDA-defined food desert
* 10,000+ downtown corridor residents must travel over 1 mile for full-service groceries
* Residents rely on corner stores / fast food, contributing to disproportionate diet-related illness


#### Main Point #2: Viable Market: Downtown Wilmington is undergoing demographic and economic growth
* Downtown residential units have grown by 28% since 2019, led by millennial professionals, retirees, and hybrid workers
* Median household income has increased by 17%, with population density comparable to peer cities
* Local employers have shown support for amenities aligned with live-work-play environments



#### Main Point #3: Strategic Alignment: A grocery store supports broader city and state redevelopment goals
* City of Wilmingtonâ€™s 2023 Strategic Development Plan prioritizes mixed-use urban revitalization anchored by food, health, and transit
* Downtown Development District Grant Program offers incentives for projects that promote equitable development and reduce retail vacancy
* Public-private partnerships are building momentum for inclusive infrastructure

#### Final Synthesis: There should be a grocery store in Downtown Wilmington. 
* The market exists.
* The population is ready.
* Development aligns with public goals.


### Principle 1: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive
**Mutually Exclusive:** Each main point or piece of evidence is distinctly different.

**Collectively Exhaustive:** Together, they make a complete whole.

### Principle 2: Summarize Up

Ideas at any level of the pyramid must always be summaries of ideas grouped below them.

### Principle 3: Logical Order

1. **Chronologially:** in the order they happen
2. **Structurally:** in natural groupings
3. **Comparitively:** in order of importance
4. **Deductive:** points build on each other
5. **Inductive:** points draw same conclusion
